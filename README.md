# Web Project Setup Script

This Bash script automates the setup of a new web development project. It creates a project directory, initializes a Git repository, and sets up a basic folder structure with initial HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. Additionally, it opens the project in Visual Studio Code.

## Features

- Prompts for project name and directory.
- Creates project directory with chosen name.
- Initializes a Git repository in the project directory.
- Creates subdirectories for CSS, JavaScript, and images.
- Generates a basic `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js` file with minimal content.
- Opens the project in Visual Studio Code.

## Prerequisites

Before you run this script, you need to have the following installed:
- **Git**: [How to install Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- **Visual Studio Code**: [How to install VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- **VS Code Command Line Interface**: The `code` command must be [available in the terminal](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac#_launching-from-the-command-line).

## Usage

1. Download the `setup_web_project.sh` script.
2. Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you've downloaded the script.
3. Make the script executable by running:
   ```bash
   chmod +x setup_web_project.sh
   ```
4. Execute the script by running:
   ```bash
   ./setup_web_project.sh
   ```
5. Follow the on-screen prompts to configure your new project.

## Customization

You can customize the script as needed to fit your specific development environment or project structure requirements. Feel free to modify the HTML, CSS, and JS templates included in the script.
